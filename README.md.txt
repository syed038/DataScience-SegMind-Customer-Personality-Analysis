# Customer Personality Analysis & Targeted Marketing - DATA SCIENCE Project. 

This project performs customer segmentation using KMeans clustering based on demographics and spending behavior. It helps businesses target the right customers and personalize marketing campaigns.

📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
- Contains data on 2,200+ customers with features like Age, Income, Marital Status, Product Spending, and more.


(Important)💡 How to Set Up on Your Desktop (Mac or Windows):

1. Create a folder on your Desktop named:

2. Move these 3 files into it:
- `customer_analysis.ipynb` (your notebook)
- `marketing_campaign.csv` (your dataset)

3. Open your Jupyter Notebook (e.g., using Anaconda or terminal):
- Navigate to the folder
- Open `customer_analysis.ipynb` and run the project

💡 What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Engineered new features like `Age` and `Total_Spent`
- Used the **Elbow method** to find the optimal number of clusters
- Applied **KMeans** to segment customers
- Visualized customer clusters by income and spending
- Extracted actionable business insights
